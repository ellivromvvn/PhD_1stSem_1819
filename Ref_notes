These are some other changes
affecting the field, teaching, and
practice of statistics:

The discipline of “data
science“ has emerged as
a field that encompasses
elements of statistics,
computer science, and
domain-specific knowledge.

More powerful and affordable
technology options
have become widely
available.

The revised GAISE College Report takes into account the many
changes in the world of statistics education and statistical practice since 2005 and suggests a direction for the future of introductory statistics courses.

5. Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.

Technology has changed the practice
of statistics and, hence, should
change what and how we teach.

lets students do analysis
more easily, opening up time
to focus on interpreting results
and testing conditions rather than
on computational mechanics.
Technology should aid students in
learning to think statistically and
to discover concepts, sometimes
through the use of simulation.
It should also facilitate access to
real (and possibly large) data sets,
foster active learning, and embed
assessment into course activities.
Statistics is practiced with
computers, usually with specially
designed computer software.
Students should learn to use a
statistical software package, if
possible. Calculators can provide
some limited functionality for
smaller data sets, but their use
should be supplemented with
experience reading typical output
from statistical software (e.g.,
Minitab, SPSS, R/RStudio).
Regardless of the tools used,
it is important to view the use of
technology as not just a way to
generate statistical output, but a
way to explore conceptual ideas
and enhance student learning.
