These are some other changes
affecting the field, teaching, and
practice of statistics:

The discipline of “data
science“ has emerged as
a field that encompasses
elements of statistics,
computer science, and
domain-specific knowledge.

More powerful and affordable
technology options
have become widely
available.

The revised GAISE College Report takes into account the many
changes in the world of statistics education and statistical practice since 2005 and suggests a direction for the future of introductory statistics courses.

5. Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.

Technology has changed the practice
of statistics and, hence, should
change what and how we teach.

lets students do analysis
more easily, opening up time
to focus on interpreting results
and testing conditions rather than
on computational mechanics.
Technology should aid students in
learning to think statistically and
to discover concepts, sometimes
through the use of simulation.
It should also facilitate access to
real (and possibly large) data sets,
foster active learning, and embed
assessment into course activities.
Statistics is practiced with
computers, usually with specially
designed computer software.
Students should learn to use a
statistical software package, if
possible. Calculators can provide
some limited functionality for
smaller data sets, but their use
should be supplemented with
experience reading typical output
from statistical software (e.g.,
Minitab, SPSS, R/RStudio).
Regardless of the tools used,
it is important to view the use of
technology as not just a way to
generate statistical output, but a
way to explore conceptual ideas
and enhance student learning.

This paper introduces a new RStudio addin, called "Simple Course Management System," that facilitates the exchange, grading, and real-time supervision of student work in RStudio.

In Fall 2016, Dr. Carter chose R as the software for use in a discrete mathematics course and chose to use RStudio Server Professional in the cloud, because doing so brought several benefits. The aim was to make it easy for
1. Students to submit completed assignments to the instructor;
2. Students to share work with teammates;
3. The instructor to distribute course materials to students;
4. The instructor to collect completed assignments from the students;
5. The instructor to return graded assignments to the students; and
6. The instructor to monitor student work on in-class exercises in real time.

Dr. Carter created an RStudio addin that an instructor can install into his or her RStudio Server Professional account, and it provides a graphical interface that allows the instructor to
1. Distribute a file to all students in the course;
2. Collect a completed assignment from all students in the course;
3. Return a graded assignment to all students in the course; and
4. Monitor all copies of a file being worked on by all students in the course.
Students do not need to install anything; only the instructor needs to install the addin.

Distributing Files to Students

Collecting Student Work

Providing Feedback

Returning Graded Files to Students

Live Monitoring of In-Class Work

There were negative and positive feedback about the addin from the students and instructor.

Anecdotal reports have indicated that statistics undergraduates are at a competitive disadvantage relative to undergraduate computer science (CS) degree holders for entrylevel positions. Such positions tend to have data-related skills at the core of the job descriptions. At present, many CS students tend to be able to perform computations with data more easily than their statistics equivalents.

hundreds of thousands of high school students still use outmoded
calculators for their analysis, limiting their ability to
move beyond simple calculations or undertake any sense of realisticworkflowthat
they might encounter in the realworld. This
is certainly not the technology being used by data scientists.

(1) broaden the role
of multivariable methods in our curricula; (2) develop datarelated
skills early; and (3) expand the role of simulation and
computation.

Data-Related Skills

Instructors and programs will need to stay up to
date as the preferred technologies change over time.
Instructors and institutions that provide these skills will get the students. Students with these skills will get the jobs.
We need to introduce these capacities in our first and second
courses to ensure that students have sufficient depth
by the end of their programs.

Empirical Simulation to Complement Analytic
Problem Solving

Getting students to come to grips with multidimensional
thinking, preparing them to grapple with real-world problems
and complex data, and providing them with skills in computation
are challenging things to add to our curriculum. But such
an approach would help them to tackle more sophisticated problems,
assess their models and assumptions, carry out sensitivity
analyses, and check their results.

Now we face the challenges of “Big Data” and the need
for data-related skills.

Computer technology can greatly enhance statistics education by illustrating fundamental concepts such as randomness, sampling, and variability through computer simulations and visualizations.
Studies have shown that such technological enhancements to statistics instruction signicantly improve student performance,
as measured by pretest and posttest analyses.

In these situations the instructor is left to consider building his/her own teaching tool
applet. But this is not a trivial task. This can require knowledge in Java, Javascript,
HTML, CSS, and PHP languages. The time required to learn the necessary languages can
be a suficient obstacle in keeping an instructor from creating applets.

An alternative method to create web-based teaching tool applications is provided by Shiny, a recent technology created by RStudio.

With Shiny, instructors can build a teaching tool that is interactive, dynamic, user-friendly, visually appealing, and, with similar functionality to Java/Javascript applets; the only requirement is some familiarity in R.

Overall we believe it is quite feasible for anyone with some familiarity with R to be able
to create Shiny apps. One does not need to be at the level of a master R developer. In
fact, two of the co-authors were undergraduate statistics students in our department as
we developed our collection of Shiny apps.

The challenge then is to figure out how to change educational systems so that students
emerge from their schooling with data science skills and conceptual understanding needed
to participate fully in society as citizens and workers.

A huge reservoir of data is backing up, with untapped discoveries within.
The people who know how to work with data are in short supply. These people are data
scientists. Future data scientists are in elementary school today, but unless the K–12
school curriculum changes so that data science education is a significant part of a young
person’s learning experience, many fewer data scientists than we need will emerge in the
next decades.

The four areas
considered here are inter-disciplinary use of data, software and its role in providing access
to data, goals for teaching with data that transcend subject matter content, and research
that needs to done to improve curriculum development.

A prerequisite to meaningful implementation of “data across the curriculum” is agreement
on a progression of encounters with data science concepts and skills.

It is not possible to have
meaningful learning experiences
in data science without frequent
use of the technologies that have
bro u g h t a b o u t t h e d a t a
revolution.

Statistics itself is rapidly changing under the influence of the data revolution (Friedman,
2001). Inevitably, statistics education lags behind. As Cobb (2007) has argued, statistics
courses are mired in teaching techniques developed by pre-computer-era statisticians to
circumvent their lack of computational power.

But the advocacy role will require statistics educators to step
outside their comfortable disciplinary silo and reach out to educators in other science and
math disciplines to understand how data science can be integrated into their curricula.
