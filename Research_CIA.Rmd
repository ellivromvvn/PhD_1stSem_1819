# Introduction

## Rationale

Technological advancement has led to the emergence of big data [@gould14] making data inevitable in our daily life. In addition, powerful computers are now easily available [@finzer13]. These developments gave way to the emergence of data science as a field.  In turn, these advances have dramatically changed the practice of statistics [@wood18]. To cope up with these changes, in 2005, @franklin07 put forth some recommendations as framework for statistics education both in the k to 12 and college level. In 2016, the @GCR16 revisited the effectiveness of the framework and still found it effective. New Zealand who adopted the framework, has benefited .
