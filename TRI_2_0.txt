New technologies contribute to a better quality of life
1. Technology gives me more freedom of mobility 
Technology gives people more control over their daily lives 
2. Technology makes me more productive in my personal life

3. Other people come to me for advice on new technologies 
4. In general, I am among the first in my circle of friends to acquire new technology when it appears 
I can usually figure out new high-tech products and services without help from others 
5. I keep up with the latest technological developments in my areas of interest 

When I get technical support from a provider of a high-tech product or service, 
	I sometimes feel as if I am being taken advantage of by someone who knows more than I do
6. Technical support lines are not helpful because they don’t explain things in terms I understand 
7. Sometimes, I think that technology systems are not designed for use by ordinary people 
There is no such thing as a manual for a high-tech product or service that’s written in plain language 

8. People are too dependent on technology to do things for them 
9. Too much technology distracts people to a point that is harmful  
10. Technology lowers the quality of relationships by reducing personal interaction 
I do not feel confident doing business with a place that can only be reached online
