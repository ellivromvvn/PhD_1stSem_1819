# Introduction to **R**

## The **R** Environment  
- **R** is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.
- It is an open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- It is an environment within which many classical and modern statistical techniques have been implemented.
- A few of these techniques are built into the base **R** environment, but many are supplied as packages.
- **R** is an *expression language* with a very simple syntax. It is *case sensitive*.
- The entities that **R** creates and manipulates are known as *objects*. These may be variables, arrays of numbers, character strings, functions, or more general structures built from such components.

## RStudio
- R Studio provides a graphical interface for **R**. The components of the environment are all nicely integrated into a four-panel layout.

- The RStudio provides most of the desired features of **R** in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- The **console** provides the command-line interface for interactive use of **R**. This is where users issue commands for **R** to evaluate.
- The **source** tab is a built-in text editor.
- The **Environment** tab is an interactive list of **R** objects.
- The **Files** tab displays the files and subdirectories of a given directory.
- Display of graphics is rendered in the **Plots** tab.
- RStudio keeps a stack of past commands and allows one to scroll through them easily. This can be done using the up or down keys. In addition, the **History** tab allows one to scroll through past commands.
- The **Packages** tab allows users to effortlessly load, install, update, and/or delete packages in the library of packages.
- The **Help** tab is an output location for help commands and help search window.
- The **Viewer** tab is an advanced tab for local web content.

## Basic Commands
- **R** uses *functions* to perform operations. To run a function called `funcname`, we type

`funcname(input1, input2)`

*Example*

We use the function `c()` to create a vector of numbers
```{r}
x <- c(1, 4, 3, 4, 4)
x
```

- Note that the `>` is not part of the command; rather, it is printed by **R** to indicate that it is ready for another command to be entered.
- Hitting the *up arrow key* multiple times will display the previous commands, which can then be edited.
- Typing `?funcname` will cause **R** to open a new help file window with additional information about the function `funcname`.

## Data Type and Objects
- Scalars -- atomic quantity and can hold only one value at a time.  
Examples: number, logical value, character(string)
